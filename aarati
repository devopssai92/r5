Not only does the relationship grow but there is also personal growth.

People often talk about love, but most of us are not fully aware about its true essence.
 There is lot of misconception about efficacy of love that holds us back to generate loving feelings towards others.

Love is not possessiveness.
 People look love as a possession that has to be acquired and preserved. 
 To expect that others ought to provide it to us so that our life is filled with love is the biggest fallacy, which is cause of much unhappiness. 
 It is not like any other material thing to be demanded from others. Even if other person offers us plenty of love, we may not be able to feel it. 
 It is normal to blame others for not loving us, but much depends on our inner self whether it has capability to feel it from others.
